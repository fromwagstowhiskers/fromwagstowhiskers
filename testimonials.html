                <p>"Lisa is a wonderful cat-sitter. I really appreciate knowing I will come home to find Lily happy, healthy and well-fussed. Lisa doesn't just do the necessary feeding and watering but she also takes time to play Lily's favourite games and to keep her entertained. I know my cat will have fun while I'm away, which means a great deal to me. Lisa has also been really flexible and accommodating when I've had to change plans at the last minute. She is a star, thank you Lisa!"</p>

                <p>"Lisa kindly looked after our 2 beautiful pusscats, Mr Piggles and Tiger-Loaf whilst we were away for the day/night. After her initial 'meet', I absolutely loved her and felt like I'd found a new best friend - she's just FAB! When we went away I felt entirely relaxed knowing that the cats were in good care. I hate leaving them as they're needy little things but Lisa was just great. <br><br>
                    When we got back we had a fridge magnet with one of the cats on (the other cat hid quite a lot), a lovely door hangy thing (like a 'Do Not Disturb' sign) with a different image of Mr Piggles and a bottle of milk for us! I mean, how awesome is that! Not only that, Lisa keeps a full account of times visited, duration of stay and interactions. Amazing! <br><br>
                    Lisa, you went above and beyond and I will never use anyone else. You deserve to do wonderfully well as you go the extra step in providing love and attention to our furry friends. <br><br>
                    A truly professional service. So, get your diary open because I'll be coming back to you very soon. Lisa, you're a star. Thank you once again. xx"</p>

                <p>"Lisa visited our house twice a day for two weeks to make sure our cats were fed (as opposed to fed up) watered and fussed. And we can see from Lisa’s daily log that both our cats were around whenever she was - this is an excellent recommendation for Lisa’s cat wrangling skills, as one of our cats is a renowned wanderer and has been known to vanish for days on end, even when we’re in the house. <br><br>
                    We got back from holiday to two happy and healthy cats, neither displaying the off-handedness we’ve seen after previous holidays, which is all thanks Lisa. <br><br>
                    Overall, outstanding service and top value for money."</p>

                <p>"Thank you so much for coming into our home each day to take care of our cat while we were away for a few days. It was good to know that our cat was in his own familiar territory while still getting fed and cared for. You provide such a great, caring and professional service, and I would definitely recommend your services. I loved the fact that you did a diary of events each day, and the photo keyring you left for us was a lovely touch and nice surprise. The milk you left in the fridge was really appreciated too! Oh, and thank you for watering our hanging baskets - I think they would have withered away in the hot spell we had!"</p>

                <p>"It’s the second time you’ve come to my and Jimmy’s rescue at very short notice Lisa.  Thank you so much. Just to say (again) that Jimmy has been so obviously content each time – and for a hyperthyroid, 18 year old, at times very determined puss that’s quite something. And I have had real peace of mind knowing that not only had he taken his medication as prescribed but you had given him his food in exactly the way he likes it.  He was as if I had never been away which is exactly as I like it. <br><br>
                    You took time to ensure that that you were familiar with his routine and he had clearly enjoyed the time you spent with him. And you found a way round the fact that I had inadvertently locked a crucial door (didn’t do that again!). See you again soon."</p>

I can't say enough how great it is to have finally found someone I can totally trust to keep my two indoor cats safely inside the house, and at the same time keep the hamster and guinea pigs safely locked away from them. <br><br>
                    I could tell when you came to visit the pets beforehand that you absolutely love caring for animals as you took time to ask questions to get to know each animal's preferences and habits. You contacted me after the first visit to set my mind at rest which meant I could relax and enjoy my break, knowing my pets were happy and in safe hands.  It was so lovely to return to happy, contented pets, and to the photo magnet and diary sheet you left were lovely. The milk in the fridge for a cuppa on my return, (with its lovely welcome home message and photo of the guinea pigs!) was a lovely touch   Thank you Lisa - I will be singing your praises to all my pet-owning friends and will definitely come to you for help next time I go away!"</p>

Lisa reassured me on her visit to the house in terms of the service she offered and the questions she asked to find out about Jenny.  Upon returning home it was lovely to have a relaxed and stress free cat who had been able to stay in her own house.  Jenny had clearly been well looked after with lots of cuddles.  The little extras of the fridge magnet and photos was a lovely touch and the pint of milk was very welcome for a cup of tea in the early hours of the morning!

                <p>"Thank you for looking after Meg and Mog so well. I hated leaving them over the holidays, but was very pleased that you were able to pass on Christmas cuddles for us! They were able to stay in their own home, and that is important to us. We got them from Cats Protection and I don't like the idea of disrupting them again by putting them in a cattery as Mog especially gets nervous when she goes out. Returning to a day by day report and the extra bits -milk, photos, etc. was a great touch and made us feel a whole lot less guilty! We will definitely be in touch next time we go away.

                <p>"Lisa came highly recommended by a friend who has used her pet sitting service many times. From the first exchange of our emails I knew I really liked Lisa and warmed to her straight away.  When Lisa came to meet us I instantly knew everything was going to be fine and that I'd found the most professional, loveliest lady to look after my precious boys.  This feeling was further concreted when the cats came to meet Lisa for themselves, her reaction on seeing them gave me all the encouragement I needed and I knew my boys would be looked after purrrrrrrfecty.  I'd written many notes about the boys habits and requirements and even though there was a lot to take in, Lisa assured me nothing was too much trouble. So after meeting Lisa and waving her off, for once I actually started to look forward to my break away rather than dreading it. <br><br>
                    On our return we found three very contented boys and we couldn't have been happier ourselves.  Lisa went above and beyond to look after Zachary, Dexter and Dylan and she stayed so much longer than the advertised half hour visit to give each of them some love and company.  We were tickled pink with the gorgeous little fridge magnet with Dexters face on, it was such a special touch and the milk in the fridge was very welcome.  There was also lots of photos of the boys on a sheet of paper and what they had done on their 'holidays' and also a diary of what Lisa and the boys had done while she was here and the times she came and left. This is how I know she spent so much more time with them than I ever would have expected and I can't thank her enough. <br><br>
                    My cats are loved more than I could ever express and leaving them is very difficult for me, but I am thrilled to be able to say that I've found a true gem in Lisa and I know I can now book some more breaks without having to worry about the boys.  I can't recommend her enough, she is absolutely fabulous!! <br><br>

                <p>"This was the first time we had used a cat sitter, we usually take our cat Harvey to our local cattery, but as he is almost 11 years old now, he seemed upset at being moved around to a strange place.  Also my husband had tomatoes which needed to be watered every day, so the choice was easy to make, as Lisa gave us the freedom to go away for a few days happily knowing Harvey would be well looked after and the tomatoes would flourish !! Lisa is so caring and thoughtful, when we arrived back home there was a lovely gift of a keyring with Harveys photo and a fresh pint of milk to greet us. Together with a daily report sheet showing how each day had gone. <br><br>
                    We would both highly recommend Lisa for the perfect service she provides!"</p>

                    I was concerned about one of cats who can be nervous around people he doesn't know, but I needn't have worried Lisa as was great with him and he was her best friend by the end of the week.<br><br>
                    Lisa visited our home before we went away and got a full picture of the cats, their behaviour and how we would like her to look after them.  I felt comfortable with her coming and going and the additional security was reassuring.<br><br>
                    I have no doubt that if there had been a problem Lisa would have the knowledge to deal with it and her strong links to Cramar through the vets and her volunteering are a great back-up.<br><br>

It is clear that Lisa adores animals and Ollie took to her immediately when she initially came to introduce herself to him.

                <p>"If you are looking for a pet sitter, who is reliable, caring and professional, contact Lisa fromwagstowhiskers.co.uk, then relax, you have just cotacted the perfect person for the job. I needed a dog walker/feeder and someone I could trust with my dog Daisy, at very short notice. Lisa agreed to help out even though I explained that I have already had dog walkers who we are really pleased with, but needed someone to help out over just a two day period. Whilst talking to Lisa on the phone I felt that things would be fine. We arranged for Lisa to coe and meet us and Daisy, and straight away I was able to  relax. Lisa was very professional and noted all Daisy's likes/dislikes and her quirky ways, like her taking a dislike to peoples shoes in the house and trying to bite their toe caps if given the chance (Daisy I mean not Lisa) and yes Daisy did manage to get a swift nip of the offending toecap. Lisa has a lovely calm energy about her and she is really easy to like. When we arrived home after Lisa's first day with Daisy, Lisa had left a full report of Daisy's activities, where she went for her walk, when she was fed, etc. and even that Daisy had decided Lisa's toecaps would be spared the normal obligatory nip. The following day Lisa had again given us a full report again on her activities, and she had even taken a photograph of Daisy which was made into a fridge magnet, a really lovely touch! <br><br>
                    I will definitely call Lisa again, should I need her and I reccommend that you should do the same, then you can relax in knowing that your pet couldn't be in  better hands!"</p>

Lisa was so attentive, she bought extra cat food and added on extra days when we were delayed, took photos, made a fridge magnet and wrote up detailed notes each day.

Lisa visited twice a day to walk and feed the dogs and also check on and feed the cats and give them a fuss. She had to cope with heavy snow and ice, but she still managed to provide an excellent and meticulous service, and walked my dogs separately as I had requested. I could see when I came home that my pets had not been phased at all by someone relatively unfamiliar coming into the house. They looked happy and contented. Lisa had also kindly fed the wild birds in my garden. Lisa goes above and beyond the call of duty: on my return home I found a new key ring with a picture of my collie Riddley attached, and a bottle of milk from ‘Rufus’ in the fridge! Plus a full written report on everything she’d done with my animals and a welcome home card too! Lisa is completely devoted to her work and has a natural affinity with animals. <br><br>

Lisa came round and instantly put our minds at rest; even though they are rabbits and not as 'needy' as dogs and cats, Lisa bothered to find out what they were like and what their preferences are with regards to care, which was very reassuring. <br><br>

                <p>"Hello! Our names are Squeak and Whisper and Lisa came to look after us when Mum went on holiday and it was just the best thing she ever did for us!  We had been to a local cattery once before for a couple of days but we were frightened because we are a shy pair of kitties and it was a strange place.  Mum didn’t want to send us back there but she didn’t know what else to do whilst she went on holiday!  Then Mum’s friend told her about Lisa and her love for all things furry and she gave her a call. Lisa came to visit us before Mum went away and she asked loads of questions about our little habits so that she knew all about us before Mum left.  Whilst she was away, Lisa kept us fed and clean and tidy and we were so happy to be at home instead of in a cattery.  She wrote Mum a daily report on our behaviour so we had to be good girls and she even opened and closed the curtains morning and night so we had a bit of privacy!  We had some nice little ‘kittie chats’ with Lisa and when we posed for the odd photo she sent it on to Mum to show her that we were being good girls!  We loved Lisa looking after us and we want her to come back again when mum goes on holiday next!  Mum says she would recommend Lisa to anybody to guarantee that their pets are loved and cared for – doing just what she promises: “providing love and care when you can’t be there”!"</p>

                <p>"Lisa is reliable and adaptable. She looks out for/after your pet as if it were her own. She takes time out to get to know your dog and I feel comfotable and confident when I am at work that my dog is in the best possible care!"</p>

                <p>"My kitten, Pumpkin, was only 11 months old and I was due to take a 2 week holiday. I was in a real dilemma about whether to put him in a cattery, have him stay with a friend or let him stay in his own home. Lisa was recommended to me and, having returned just yesterday, I can say it was the best decision ever! I have come home to a very happy, contented and well-looked after cat. He has not had the stress of being taken away from his home and he has received all the love and attention he needs, especially with him still being so young. It was so reassuring to know that he formed a close bond with her very quickly (and for quite a timid cat, that is a testament to Lisa's clear love for and experience of animals). Having Lisa visit my house has also meant I have had someone to check things are secure. She even text me some information I had left behind - she really went above and beyond! I have already recommended Lisa to several friends which I think says it all about how impressed I was with the service she has provided. Pumpkin and I are extremely happy customers!"</p>
